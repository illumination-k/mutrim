name: find-duplicates
description: Use when the user asks to find duplicated, near-duplicate, copy-pasted, or forwarding-only functions in this codebase, duplicated or drifted struct/class/interface/type definitions (`--target types`), repeated boilerplate or copy-pasted fragments *inside* functions (`--target blocks`), or how many forwarding hops sit between an entry point and the real work — or before adding a new function or type, to check whether something similar already exists. Wraps `agent-lens analyze similarity`, `agent-lens analyze wrapper`, and `agent-lens analyze delegation`.

# Find duplicate and forwarding functions

Three analyzers cover the "is this already written?" and "why does this take four files?" questions:

- `similarity` — pairs of functions whose normalised AST has TSED ≥ threshold (default `0.85`). Catches type-3 clones (logic-equivalent, names differ). Functions shorter than `--min-lines` (default `5`) are skipped to keep getters and one-liners out of the report. With `--target types` it compares type definitions instead, and with `--target blocks` runs of statements inside function bodies — see below.
- `wrapper` — functions whose body is `?` / `.into()` / `.unwrap()` / `.await` chained around a single forwarding call. Either inline or justify.
- `delegation` — what `wrapper` becomes when it stacks: chains where every hop only forwards, reported with the terminus (the function doing the work) as the headline, plus a per-module roll-up that flags modules built almost entirely out of forwarders.

All three parse Rust, TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, and Go (parser is selected from the file extension). All accept files or directories, and more than one of either; in directory mode they walk recursively (respecting `.gitignore` like ripgrep). `similarity` reports cross-file pairs alongside in-file ones; `wrapper` groups findings per file; `delegation` needs a directory to see across files at all.

## Workflow

### 1. If the user is about to add a function

Run similarity on the file the new function would live in, with the default threshold:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity <path> --format md
```

Read the report. If a candidate scores ≥ 0.85, surface it to the user before writing any code: "There's already `foo::bar` at `<path>:42` that does this — fork or extend?"

### 2. If the user is reviewing an in-progress edit

Restrict to the changed functions only — the rest of the file is noise:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity <path> --diff-only --format md
agent-lens analyze wrapper    <path> --diff-only --format md
agent-lens analyze delegation <dir>  --diff-only --format md
```

### 3. If the user is auditing a whole file or crate

All three accept a directory, so you don't need to loop manually. `similarity` reports cross-file pairs alongside in-file ones; `wrapper` groups findings per file (capped at `--top`, default 20); `delegation` needs the directory to follow a chain across files:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity crates/<name>/src --format md
agent-lens analyze wrapper    crates/<name>/src --format md
agent-lens analyze delegation crates/<name>/src --format md
```

In a monorepo the trees you care about are usually siblings, and their only common ancestor drags in `node_modules` and generated output. Pass them all at once instead — one corpus, so a duplicate spanning two of them is found where three separate runs cannot see it:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity packages cli web/src --format md --exclude-tests
```

## Tuning the threshold

- `--threshold 0.95` — only true clones. Use this when the report is too noisy.
- `--threshold 0.75` — catches reshuffled logic. Use this on a small file when the user explicitly wants to find loose duplicates.
- Default `0.85` — what the `PostToolUse` hook uses, so it matches what the agent will see during edits.

## Sweeping multiple thresholds

When you don't know the right cut — or want to tell verbatim clones apart from structurally parallel implementations in one pass — sweep a ladder instead of guessing a single `--threshold`:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity <path> --format md --sweep 0.6,0.75,0.85
```

This clusters once at the lowest rung (`0.6`) and tags each cluster with the highest rung at which its complete-link structure survives. A cluster tagged `[survives ≥0.85]` is a near-verbatim clone (extract now); `[survives ≥0.6]` is a structural parallel that needs a shared abstraction rather than a literal extraction. `--sweep` conflicts with `--threshold` (it replaces the single cut). Reach for it when the default run reports _nothing_ between two files you suspect are duplicated — the looser pairs only show up at the lower rungs.

## Finding semantic clones (`--method pdg`)

The default score is a tree-edit distance, so it reads a body as the order its
statements were written in: two functions that compute the same thing with
independent statements shuffled, the locals renamed, or a value threaded
through a differently named temporary score low. `--method pdg` scores the
body's program dependence graph instead — one node per statement, edges for
"this statement decides whether that one runs" and "this statement binds a
name that one reads":

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity <path> --method pdg --format md
```

Reordering independent statements and renaming locals leave the graph alone,
so such pairs score `1.0` here. Reach for it when the default report misses a
pair you know is the same computation, or to confirm that a high TSED pair is
the same _logic_ and not just the same shape: half the score is the wiring,
half is the statements themselves, so a body with the same statement kinds and
dependences but different statements bottoms out at `0.5`. Scores are not
comparable across methods, and `--method token` is the cheap third option
(token k-gram overlap) for very large corpora.

Two blind spots to read around. Anything an adapter lowers to an opaque leaf
(a Rust macro invocation, a closure body in TypeScript) hides the names it
reads, so a body that is mostly `println!` / `format!` arguments has fewer
dependences than it should. And the TypeScript lowering keeps only the
right-hand side of `x = …`, so plain reassignment is a read, never a binding.

## Finding siblings that drifted apart (`--paired-by`)

Everything above answers "what is still similar?". That question has a
built-in blind spot: two implementations of the same thing that have drifted
apart score _lower_, so the more urgently a sync was missed, the less likely
the report is to mention it. The report is always a lower bound, and it
degrades exactly when the situation gets worse.

`--paired-by` inverts it — match by name first, score second:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity <dir> --format md --paired-by name
```

Every cross-file name match is reported regardless of threshold, grouped by
key and ordered worst-pair-first. Reach for it when the codebase maintains
parallel implementations on purpose — language bindings (NAPI / WASM /
PyO3), a server and client copy of the same model, per-analyzer boilerplate —
and you want to know which copy fell behind.

Two keys:

- `name` (a.k.a. `qualified`) — the normalized owner-qualified name. Case and
  separator conventions fold away (`getUser` = `get_user`) and binding affixes
  are stripped from the owner, so `Summary::from` matches `JsSummary::from`.
  Start here.
- `method` — the method segment alone, so every `::from` in the tree groups
  together. Use it when the mirror types were renamed past recognition; expect
  unrelated same-named functions in the output.

Reading the output: a group headed
`` `render_modules` — 4 functions, similarity 34–98%, 3/4 pair(s) drifted ``
means four functions share the name, some pair of them is 98% identical, and
some other pair is down at 34%. That spread _is_ the finding — the 98% pair
shows what the shared implementation is supposed to look like, and the 34%
member is the one that fell behind.

Pairs scoring below `--drift-floor` (default `0.30`) are dropped as unrelated
namesakes rather than reported as drift — two functions that merely happen to
share a common name (`new`, `format_markdown`) are not a missed sync. The
count of what was dropped is printed, so a big number is itself a signal that
the key is too loose. Pass `--drift-floor 0` to see everything.

Same-file namesakes are excluded: siblings are a cross-file pattern, and a
file's own overloads would otherwise dominate the `method` key. The skipped
count is reported too, so an empty report tells you which kind of empty it is.

`--paired-by` conflicts with `--sweep` (which annotates clusters; this mode
doesn't cluster).

## Comparing type definitions (`--target types`)

`--target types` switches the comparison unit from function bodies to type
definitions: Rust `struct` / `enum` / `type` alias, TS `interface` / `type`
alias / `enum`, Python annotated classes (dataclass / TypedDict / pydantic)
and `Enum` subclasses, Go `struct` / defined types. Each definition is
compared by its member shape — field names and types (naming conventions
folded, so `userId` matches `user_id`), enum variants, alias targets — so
duplicated DTOs, copy-pasted config structs, and drifted mirror types
surface the same way duplicated functions do:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity <dir> --target types --format md
agent-lens analyze similarity <dir> --target types --paired-by name --format md
```

The second form is the drift detector for parallel type hierarchies:
`Summary` / `JsSummary` / `PySummary` share a key (binding affixes are
stripped), and every cross-file pair is reported worst-first regardless of
threshold. `--paired-by method` is rejected for types — a type has no
method segment to key on.

Everything composes as with functions: `--diff-only`, `--sweep`, `--top`,
`--threshold`, `--exclude-tests`. Two defaults differ: `--min-lines`
defaults to `3` (types run shorter than function bodies; one-line aliases
and unit structs are dropped), and candidate generation is always exact
(no LSH), so very large corpora (`>~5k` eligible types) hit the scope
guardrail — narrow the path or raise `--min-lines`.

Reading type output: small structs clear `0.85` more easily than function
bodies, so on a noisy report raise `--threshold 0.9`–`0.95` or lean on
`identifier overlap` in the headline — a high body score with high
identifier overlap is a copy-pasted type; with low overlap it is two
different entities that happen to have the same shape (often fine). In
JSON, each unit carries a `kind` (`struct`, `interface`, `enum`,
`type_alias`, `class`, `dataclass`) so cross-language pairs are explicit.

## Finding repeated fragments inside functions (`--target blocks`)

`similarity` normally compares whole definitions, so duplication that lives
_inside_ larger functions never surfaces no matter how often it repeats: the
enclosing functions differ, so they never cluster. `--target blocks` switches
the comparison unit to runs of consecutive statements, which is what an
extract-a-helper refactor actually targets:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity <dir> --target blocks --format md --exclude-tests
```

Use it when a function-level report reads as "little duplication here" but the
code obviously repeats itself — a mapped-error tail at every call site, a
URL-assembly preamble in every endpoint method, the same parse-and-check
prologue at the top of a dozen extractors.

Reading block output. Each cluster headline gives the occurrence count, the
similarity band, the quoted occurrence's length, and — the part that decides
the fix — how many distinct functions and files it spans:

````text
- 7 blocks, similarity 100–100%, 9 line(s), in 7 function(s) across 6 file(s)
  - at lens-ts/src/call_index.rs:`extract_function_shapes_with_module` (L32-40)
    ```
    <the repeated source>
    ```
  - occurrences: lens-ts/src/call_index.rs ×2, lens-ts/src/coupling.rs ×1, …
````

Rather than listing every occurrence, the report quotes one and breaks the
rest down by file — a 55-site fragment would otherwise bury the whole report.
"N occurrences in N functions across N files" is a shared-helper candidate;
"N occurrences in 1 function" is usually a loop or a match the author wrote
out longhand.

Two things the target does on your behalf, which are worth knowing so an empty
report is not misread. Overlapping windows never pair with each other: sliding
windows cover the same lines by construction, so a function would otherwise
report itself as a cluster of its own sub-windows. And when a repeated run and
a shorter fragment inside it would both cluster, only the longer form is kept
— unless the shorter one also repeats somewhere the longer one does not, which
makes it a finding in its own right.

Defaults and limits: `--min-lines` defaults to `3`, windows cover at most 8
statements, and a window that lowers to a trivially small tree is dropped
(a Rust `matches!` body is one node however long it is). `--paired-by` is
rejected — a statement window has no name to key siblings on. Everything else
composes as with functions: `--diff-only`, `--sweep`, `--top`, `--threshold`,
`--exclude-tests`.

## Excluding tests

Table-driven tests dominate similarity reports. If a Rust file is mostly tests, add `--exclude-tests`:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity crates/lens-domain/src/apted.rs --exclude-tests
```

This drops `#[test]` / `#[rstest]` / `#[<runner>::test]` free functions and everything inside `#[cfg(test)] mod` blocks.

## What to do with the output

- **TSED ≥ 0.95** — almost certainly a clone. Extract a shared helper, or delete one.
- **TSED 0.85–0.95** — same shape, different specifics. Worth a closer look; sometimes legitimate (e.g. visitor cases that happen to mirror each other), sometimes an extracted parameter away from being one function.
- **`identifier overlap`** (always in the markdown cluster headline; `identifier_overlap` per pair in JSON) — how much the two functions' names and parameter names agree. Read it against the body score, because the two answer different questions. A high body score _with_ high identifier overlap is a verbatim clone: the bodies differ only in literals, and collapsing them is mechanical. A high body score with _low_ identifier overlap is the same shape applied to different entities — identical control flow over different types and names — where the honest fix is a generic helper, or nothing. The similarity band alone cannot separate the two, and they carry very different risk.
- **`doc_overlap`** (per pair in JSON, present when both functions have a doc comment / docstring; add `--doc-overlap` to roll it up per cluster in `--format md`) — word-level overlap of the two docs. It never affects the score; read it as a tiebreaker: high `doc_overlap` on a high-similarity pair means the _stated intent_ matches too (strong merge candidate, often a copy-paste including the doc), while low `doc_overlap` on a high-similarity pair flags a structural coincidence — two functions that happen to share a shape but do different jobs, which usually should not be merged.

  ```bash
  agent-lens analyze similarity crates/<name>/src --format md --doc-overlap
  ```

  The markdown rollup reads `doc overlap 20–80% (3/3 pairs documented)`: the range across the cluster's pairs, then how many of them had doc text on both sides. `n/a (0/N pairs documented)` means nothing in the cluster is documented — the tiebreaker is unavailable, not zero.
- **wrapper hit, single call site** — inline it.
- **wrapper hit, many call sites** — keep, but verify the indirection is doing real work (lifetime adjustment, trait dispatch, error mapping). If not, the function is a tax.
- **delegation chain** — open the terminus first; every hop above it is a file you would otherwise read for nothing. Weigh the fix by the per-hop `other caller(s) to move`: a chain whose hops have no other callers collapses to a direct call in one edit, while a hop with many callers means repointing all of them. Trust hops marked `args forwarded verbatim` most; an unmarked hop was classified from body shape alone and may be composing (a constructor calling a constructor) rather than forwarding.
- **delegation module flagged `layer candidate`** — the module is mostly forwarders aimed at one other module. That is an architectural finding, not a per-function one: inline the layer or give it a reason to exist.

## Confirming call-site count for a wrapper hit

`wrapper` reports a hit but doesn't tell you _how many_ call sites it has — and "many call sites" vs "one call site" decides between inline and keep. Use `function-graph` to count:

```bash
agent-lens analyze function-graph crates/<name>/src \
  | jq --arg fn "<wrapper-fn-name>" '
      [.edges[] | select(.callee_name == $fn)] | length'
```

If the count is `1`, inline the wrapper. If `2+`, look at the call sites (`.edges[] | select(.callee_name == $fn) | {from, call_lines}`) before deciding. Resolution is heuristic, so treat the count as "at least N", not exact.

## Don't reach for it when

- The "duplication" is structural / architectural (e.g. two services that do the same job) — that's a coupling/coherence question, not a TSED one.
- The file isn't Rust / TypeScript / JavaScript / Python / Go — the analyzer errors out cleanly on unsupported extensions.
