name: agent-lens
description: Use when the user asks to analyze this codebase with agent-lens, or asks which analyzer fits a given question (duplication, complexity, hotspots, coupling, cohesion, forwarding wrappers, delegation chains). Routes to the right `agent-lens analyze` subcommand and explains how to read the output. Prefer the more specific skills (find-duplicates, review-pending-changes, find-refactor-targets, audit-architecture) when one of them clearly fits.

# agent-lens analyzer dispatcher

`agent-lens` is the project's own CLI. The binary is on `PATH` after `mise install`; if `agent-lens --version` fails, build it with `cargo build -p agent-lens` and use `./target/debug/agent-lens`.

## Pick the analyzer

| Question                                                | Subcommand        | Path argument                                     |

`similarity` / `wrapper` / `delegation` / `single-use` / `cohesion` / `complexity` / `function-graph` / `graph-query` / `cycles` / `hubs` / `impact` / `layers` / `untested` / `context-span` work on Rust, TypeScript / JavaScript, Python, and Go (`single-use` can only vouch for a clean, caveat-free candidate on Rust and Go, the two languages with extracted export status — TS and Python rows always carry that caveat). `delegation` is strongest on Rust: only Rust and Go can exempt a module facade, and the per-language forwarding idioms it does not model (Python properties, Go embedded structs) only cost it findings. `visibility`, `unreachable`, `test-only`, and `single-impl` judge Rust and Go only — TypeScript and Python carry no extracted export status (nor extracted trait/interface declarations), and each says how many functions or files it skipped for that reason (`unreachable` treats them as entry points, so nothing they call is reported). `coupling` and `communities` work on Rust crates, TS/JS module graphs, Go modules, and Python package trees; both grow one module graph from one entry point. Read `communities` top-down: if its declared modularity is close to its detected one, the declared boundaries already are the clustering and the misfiled rows below it are noise. For `context-span`, pass `--entry-glob` repeatedly to merge several TS/JS entry trees (Next.js App Router, Remix, Astro, …) in one run. `hotspot`, `risk`, `co-change`, `change-entropy` and `hidden-coupling` require a git working tree. `hidden-coupling` is the only analyzer that reads both halves: its history side is language-agnostic like `co-change`, and its static side is the same Rust / TS / JS / Python / Go graphs `coupling` and the call-graph analyzers build. `co-change` and `change-entropy` have no language matrix at all — both read `git log` and never parse a file, so they are the only analyzers that see `.toml`, `.md`, workflow YAML and fixtures.

## Several paths in one run

Every analyzer except `coupling`, `context-span` and `communities` takes more than one PATH, and walks them all into a single report:

```bash
agent-lens analyze similarity packages cli web/src --format md --exclude-tests
```

Reach for this in a monorepo, where the trees you care about are siblings and their only common ancestor is the repo root (which drags in `node_modules`, generated output, and everything else). It is not the same as running the analyzer once per tree: `similarity` clusters across the whole corpus and the call-graph analyzers resolve edges across it, so a duplicate or a call spanning two trees is only visible in one combined run. Display paths are written relative to the paths' deepest common ancestor, so each file keeps the tree it came from in its name.

`coupling`, `context-span` and `communities` grow one module graph out of one entry point, so they keep the single-PATH signature. Use `--entry-glob` for `context-span` when a TS/JS framework has many entries; for `coupling`, pick a representative entry.

## Output format

- Default `stdout` is JSON — pipe into `jq` for ad-hoc filtering.
- Pass `--format md` when feeding the report into another agent's context window.
- Every analyzer that can emit a long markdown report takes `--top` to bound it, `cycles` excepted (a truncated cycle list reads as the whole list). JSON always carries the full result — `--top` is a rendering cap, not a filter.
- Diagnostics go to `stderr` via `tracing`. Set `RUST_LOG=debug` for verbose.

## Always prefer `--diff-only` for in-progress edits

`similarity`, `wrapper`, `cohesion`, and `complexity` accept `--diff-only`, which restricts the report to functions or `impl` blocks touching unstaged changes (`git diff -U0`). Use this on a hot file rather than dumping the whole report into context.

`change-entropy --diff-only` is the odd one out: it does not filter a report down to the diff, it _measures the diff_ — how many files and modules the pending change spans, and where its scatter sits among the commits this repository actually makes. Run it over the whole repo (`.`), not one file.

`footprint` measures the diff too, at function level: it always reads a diff (the working tree by default, untracked files included, or `--diff-range`), so there is no ungated mode to prefer it over.

## Reading the output

- **similarity**: each entry is a pair `(a, b)` with `tsed` in `[0.0, 1.0]`. ≥ 0.95 is essentially a clone; 0.85–0.95 is a near-miss worth refactoring; below 0.85 is filtered out by default. The `--threshold` flag is for tightening or loosening that bar; `--sweep 0.6,0.75,0.85` instead clusters once at the lowest rung and tags each cluster with the highest rung it survives (a coarse dendrogram), separating verbatim clones from structural parallels in one run.
- **wrapper**: a hit means the function body, after stripping `?` / `.into()` / `.unwrap()` / `.await`, is just a forwarding call. Either inline it or document why the indirection exists.
- **single-use**: each row is a function exactly one resolved production caller needs, small and simple enough (per the echoed `--max-loc` / `--max-cyclomatic` thresholds) to inline into that caller — a candidate edit, not a verdict, since a single-caller function can be a deliberate, well-named extraction. Fan-in counts resolved edges only, so a macro body (a call inside `format!`/`write!` arguments produces no call edge) or an unresolved call site can hide a second caller — the raw-name scan therefore caveats any row whose bare name is written outside its definition and its known callers (`raw refs=N`), and a shared or ubiquitous name (`new`, `get`) will in practice always carry that caveat. The scan only covers files the graph scanned, so still check config files, templates, and other languages before inlining. Caveat-free rows lead; caveated rows say exactly why they are weaker (visibility, test callers, several call sites, a cross-module caller, uncertain resolution). Thresholds are absolute and per-repository on purpose — read the report's calibration section (the loc/cyclomatic distribution over all single-caller functions) and set them in `[profile.<name>.single-use]` rather than trusting the defaults. The `Collapsible chains` section groups candidates whose one caller is itself a candidate: inline members in the listed order (deepest first) and the whole run folds into the named sink, reclaiming the summed loc.
- **single-impl**: each row is a Rust trait or Go interface declared in the analyzed tree with at most one production implementor — a candidate to replace with the concrete type, not a verdict. The caveats are the reading: `a test implementor exists (mock seam)` means the abstraction exists to be mocked and removing it moves those tests onto the concrete type; `` `dyn`-dispatched `` means a concrete type cannot replace it without restructuring; `visible outside its module` means implementors outside the analyzed tree are possible. `refs=N` is what removal costs (bounds, `impl Trait` positions, imports, derives get rewritten), not evidence the row is wrong. Go matching is structural by method name and parameter count, so a Go interface satisfied only by std or third-party types reads as unimplemented — the no-production-implementor section says which rows those may be. Read the implementor distribution last: it is this tree's base rate, and a repo where most abstractions are single-impl is telling you about its house style, not about one bad trait.
- **delegation**: each row is a chain of functions that only forward, ending at the terminus — the one doing the work, named with its `file:line`, which is the file to open first. Depth is the context tax: a 3-hop chain costs four file opens to answer one question. Trust the hops marked `args forwarded verbatim` most (the language's own wrapper detector agreed); a hop without that mark was classified from body shape alone and can be composing rather than forwarding — a constructor calling a constructor is the usual false positive. `other caller(s) to move` on a hop is the cost of collapsing the chain: those call sites have to be repointed at the terminus. The module roll-up is the lasagna half: a module flagged `layer candidate` is mostly forwarders pointing mostly at one other module, so inlining it is a single mechanical change. One-hop forwards are counted, not listed — that is `analyze wrapper`'s report, and it carries argument-level evidence.
- **cohesion**: `lcom4 == 1` is healthy. `lcom4 >= 2` means the `impl` has disjoint method clusters and is a candidate for splitting.
- **complexity**: cognitive ≥ 15 is a yellow flag, ≥ 25 is a red flag. Maintainability Index < 65 means the function is hard to maintain regardless of what cyclomatic says.
- **coupling**: high `fan_in` ⇒ a hub everything depends on (slow to change safely); high `fan_out` ⇒ a module that is hard to test in isolation; non-empty `cycles` is always a smell. Reports Martin's `instability = Ce/(Ca+Ce)` per module too. The module unit differs by language: for Rust it is the crate's `mod` tree, for TS/JS a source file reachable from the entry, for Go a package (directory) in the module, for Python a `.py` file under the root.
- **cycles**: each entry is a group of 2+ functions that call each other (directly or transitively) over resolved call edges — they must be understood, tested, and changed as one unit. `same_file: true` usually means intentional mutual recursion (parsers, tree walkers) and is ranked below cross-file tangles. `break_suggestions` name the cheapest internal edges (by static call-site count) whose removal breaks the cycle — advisory: check the listed `call_lines` before acting, a cheap edge can still be load-bearing. A high `ambiguous_edge_count_nearby` means the tangle's true extent is uncertain.
- **context-span**: each module's transitive outgoing closure plus the count of distinct source files those modules span. Treat the file count as an "onboarding cost" — a module with span 30 means an agent must open ~30 files to reason about it.
- **function-graph**: nodes are functions with per-node weights (`fan_in`, `fan_out`, complexity, MI, Halstead). Edges are syntactic call sites with a `resolution` (`resolved` / `unresolved` / `ambiguous` / `anonymous`). Resolution is heuristic — high `unresolved_edge_count` mostly means trait dispatch and external calls, not a bug. Prefer `graph-query` for point questions; use the full dump for visualization or offline processing.
- **graph-query**: one canned traversal per run — `--query callers|callees|neighborhood` from `--symbol` (depth 1 by default, `--direction in|out|both` for neighborhood), or `--query path --symbol A --to B` for the shortest call chain with per-hop call lines. Symbols match by `::`-segment suffix (`foo`, `module::foo`, `Owner::method`) or exact node id; on ambiguity the tool lists the candidates instead of guessing — re-run with one of the listed ids. Traversal follows resolved edges only, so results are lower bounds: a row with high `unres`/`ambig` counts has outgoing calls the resolver could not follow (trait dispatch, externals). Output is capped by node count (`--limit`, default 50).
- **hubs**: four ranked lists on the resolved call graph. God functions (outlier fan-out) are refactor candidates; load-bearing functions (outlier fan-in) are a blast-radius signal, not a defect — check their callers before editing them; bottlenecks spike Henry-Kafura `loc × (fan_in × fan_out)²` (size-confounded, read next to `loc`); "misplaced?" entries send most resolved call traffic to one foreign module. Degrees count resolved edges only, so they are lower bounds — the `fallback` share and the resolution-confidence section say how much to trust each number. `PR` is a deterministic PageRank-importance percentile.
- **impact**: one entry per changed function (seeded from the unstaged diff, or `--function` for a pre-edit query). `direct_callers` are verbatim; deeper callers fold to per-depth per-module counts; `reachable_tests` is the verification checklist — run those. `vfi` is the transitive caller count within `--depth` (default 5, cycles count as one hop); `beyond_depth_count` says what the cap hid. Counts follow resolved edges only and are bounds in both directions: `excluded_ambiguous_edge_count` and `unattributed_caller_edge_count` quantify would-be callers the resolver could not attribute. `impact_explosion` flags depth-2 fan-out ≥ 3× depth-1 — a hidden shotgun-surgery signal.
- **footprint**: the pending diff read on both sides. `functions` counts a function as touched when its body text changed (line shifts and reindents do not count), with cognitive complexity before and after. The four flagged lists are the part to act on: `outside_closure` — touched functions whose callers within `--depth` hops (default 2) share nothing with the largest group of touched functions, and that sit in another file; an edit the rest of the change neither reaches nor is reached by, which is what an unrequested edit looks like (and also what a dispatch-table registration looks like — check before reverting); `complexity_increases` — modified functions that got harder, and added ones at cognitive ≥ 8; `new_wrappers` — functions the diff turned into forwarders; `uncalled_additions` — added functions with no resolved or ambiguous caller outside tests whose name appears nowhere else, with `test_callers` counting tests that call them (code written only for its test). A high `add_delete_ratio` on a fix is worth a second look; on a feature it is expected.
- **layers**: two inferred layerings. `L` is a function level (`1 + max(level of its callees)`, call cycles collapsed to one node), `M` the same computation on the module graph — a module's level need not match its members' levels, since a leaf-heavy module can still hold one high-level caller. Read `entry_points` first, then the level buckets top-down. `module_cycles` is the actionable part: those modules are mutually dependent, so no ordering exists between them, and each listed call site is where the cycle is realised. `skip_calls` are downward calls jumping over an intermediate module level — expected for shared leaf utilities, worth a look when a skipped level owns the same concern. A module with a wide `member_level_span` mixes leaf helpers with orchestration. None of these are errors: callbacks and DI shape the graph the same way. Ignore rows marked `name-fallback` first — the resolver guessed those targets by last segment.
- **untested**: production functions the forward walk from every test function never reaches, grouped by module and ranked by untested LOC — start at the top, it is the largest unguarded body. Read it as "no resolved call path from a test", not "uncovered": integration tests that drive the built binary reach functions with no in-graph test caller, and those are listed here anyway. The listing is an upper bound — a row flagged `may be test-reached` is named by an ambiguous call site leaving test-reached code, so check it before writing a test. `fan_in: 0` means no production caller either, which is a dead-code question rather than a testing one. `--exclude-tests` removes the traversal's starting points and makes the report meaningless; the output says so when it happens.
- **unreachable**: three tiers, and only one of them is permission to delete. `confirmed` = private (Rust) / unexported (Go), no resolved call path from any entry point, and its bare name appears nowhere else in the scanned sources — act on those, ideally per island. `likely` = nothing in the analyzed path uses or names it, but the declaration reaches outside that path; on a library that is its published API, so check the consumers before touching it. `unknown` = a lead: something could reach it in a way the graph does not model, and the row says which (trait or interface dispatch, an annotation, an ambiguous call site, a raw name reference). Markdown shows `confirmed` only unless you pass `--tier`. Read the entry set line first — every verdict is relative to it — and the demotion breakdown next: an empty `confirmed` tier on a Rust workspace usually means the resolver could not follow the calls, not that nothing is dead (rustc's own `dead_code` lint has already taken the easy findings). Islands are the strongest signal: a cluster that only calls itself, with a total LOC and an order that removes callers before their callees. Do not run it with `--exclude-tests` before deleting: that drops the test entry points and makes code used only by tests look dead (the report says so when it happens).
- **test-only**: each row is a production function no production entry point (`main`, a public declaration, a live annotation) reaches while a test does — the code `unreachable` never reports (tests root its walk) and `untested` blesses. The edit is moving it into test scope (`#[cfg(test)]`, a `_test.go` file) or deleting it with the tests that exist only to exercise it. `production=N` refs is the hard caveat (the bare name is written inside a production body — a macro argument can be a hidden caller); `unattributed=N` is informational (imports, attributes, top-level macros — tests import what they call, and a caller the scan misses fails the compile rather than silently breaking). The public section is weaker by construction: in a library, consumers outside the tree cannot be ruled out. Never run it with `--exclude-tests` — that removes the very entry points it measures against, and the report says so.
- **visibility**: each row is a `pub` / exported function plus the visibility its resolved callers would still permit, so the row is an edit you can apply and let the compiler check — a wrong one costs a failed build, never lost code. Rows with resolved callers come first in a module section; `verify: no resolved caller in the analyzed tree` means nothing in scope calls it at all, which is a dead-code or external-API question rather than a narrowing one. A row flagged `verify first` is named by a call site the resolver could not attribute (an ambiguous call, or a receiver call on a name like `.clone()`), so confirm that caller before narrowing. A Go row annotated `may satisfy interface …` matches a method of an interface declared in the tree by name and arity — its calls can dispatch through the interface, so the missing caller is expected; those rows list last in their bucket and the annotation can be coincidental (structural match only). Run it at the workspace root: callers outside the analyzed path do not exist for this analyzer, and the report says so when only one crate is in scope. `pub use` re-exports in a crate root are excluded as intended API; a package with both `lib.rs` and `main.rs` is called out, because a `pub(crate)` whose caller sits in the binary will not compile.
- **hotspot**: rows are sorted by `commits × cognitive_max`. The top of the list is where bugs concentrate; refactor budget is best spent there first.
- **risk**: the blast-radius sibling of `hotspot`, and the one place in the tool where **lower is riskier** — `rank_product = churn_rank × centrality_rank`, so rank 1 on both axes gives 1. It answers "how carefully should I treat this edit?", not "what should I fix": a top row means read the callers and run the listed tests first. `churn_rank` and `centrality_rank` show which axis drove the row; a file high on churn but low on centrality is hot-but-leaf and safe to move fast on. `hottest_function` names the member whose PageRank carried the file, and `vfi_max` is how many functions transitively call it. Centrality follows resolved edges only, so modules listed under resolution confidence are ranked lower than they deserve.
- **co-change**: each row is a file pair with `cochanges` (commits touching both), the confidence in **both** directions, and `lift`. Read the two confidences as the closest thing to a direction: `config.rs -> config_schema.rs` at 0.82 and back at 0.86 means neither moves without the other, while 0.22 / 0.93 means one file drags the other along but not the reverse — that is the row that tells an agent what it forgot. Check `lift` before believing a row: near 1 the pair co-occurs exactly as often as two files that busy would by chance, however high its support, and the usual culprit is `Cargo.lock` or another repo-wide file. `last_cochange` dates the pattern, so a strong pair last seen 200 commits ago describes a coupling that has already been broken. It is correlation only — nothing says why two files move together — so a pair with no visible reason to be coupled is a design question, not a fact. Renames are followed; commits over `--max-commit-files` are dropped whole and counted in `skipped_commit_count`, which is where a squash-merge repo's missing history went. A shallow clone warns on stderr: fix it with `git fetch --unshallow` rather than reading the thin report.
- **hidden-coupling**: the differential, read as two separate lists. `hidden_coupling` is the one to act on: those files keep changing together and nothing in the code relates them, so look for the implicit contract — a duplicated constant, a literal both sides spell, a serialization format, a generated file with no regeneration step — and make it explicit or delete it. The `static` field says how undeclared the pair is: `no path` means nothing relates them at all, `N hops` means they only relate through N intermediate files, which is weaker. `suspect_dependencies` is the second list and is deliberately weaker: a declared edge whose two files both moved in the window but never moved together. Over one window a stable, correct dependency looks exactly like a dead one, so treat a row as a question ("is this edge still load-bearing?"), never a verdict. Two more buckets exist so they cannot be misread as findings: `test_pairs` (a test moves with its subject by construction) and `no_static_view` (no language backend reads one side — a `.md`, a manifest, workflow YAML; still a real contract, just not a missing dependency). Read the resolution-confidence section before trusting a `no path` row: unresolved call sites are edges nobody can see, so the hidden bucket is an upper bound.

## Don't reach for it when

- The user wants human-style lints (style, naming, idioms) — that's clippy / dprint / rustfmt, not agent-lens.
- The file isn't a supported language — agent-lens errors out cleanly, but check the table above first.
- The question is "is this code correct?" — analyzers measure shape, not semantics.
