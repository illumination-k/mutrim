# Find refactor targets with agent-lens

Goal: produce a short, ordered list of files and functions where a refactor is most likely to pay off, instead of letting the user guess.

The driver is **Hotspot** — `commits × cognitive_max`. A file with a high cognitive complexity that nobody touches isn't urgent. A file that everyone touches _and_ is complex is where bugs accumulate.

## Workflow

### 1. Get the hotspot ranking

Start at the workspace level, scoped to the recent past:

```bash
agent-lens analyze hotspot crates --since=180.days.ago --top 15 --format md
```

Tune `--since`:

- `90.days.ago` for "what's been hot this quarter"
- `1.year.ago` for stable repos
- omit for full history (defaults to all commits)

The path must lie inside a git working tree. For a single crate:

```bash
agent-lens analyze hotspot crates/agent-lens --since=180.days.ago --format md
```

If the question is "how carefully should I edit this?" rather than "where should I refactor?", run `risk` instead — it swaps the complexity axis for call-graph centrality, so a hot file nothing depends on stops outranking a hot file half the codebase calls:

```bash
agent-lens analyze risk crates --since=180.days.ago --top 15 --format md
```

Note the inverted direction: `risk` ranks by a rank product, so **lower is riskier**.

### 2. Drill into the top entries

For each top-ranked file, get per-function complexity:

```bash
agent-lens analyze complexity <hotspot-path> --format md
```

Read the report and pick the worst offender(s) — usually one or two functions account for the file's `cognitive_max`.

### 3. Check the surrounding `impl` / class

If the worst function lives in an `impl` block (Rust) or a class (TS/JS, Python, Go), see whether the unit itself is incoherent:

```bash
agent-lens analyze cohesion <hotspot-path> --format md
```

`lcom4 ≥ 2` plus high cognitive in the same unit means: the methods are doing unrelated jobs _and_ one of them is a landmine. Splitting the unit is a high-leverage move.

### 4. Verify the file isn't an architectural bottleneck

If the hotspot is a module that lots of other modules import from, refactoring needs more care. Run coupling and context-span on the crate (or TS/JS entry, or Go module):

```bash
agent-lens analyze coupling     crates/<name> --format md
agent-lens analyze context-span crates/<name> --format md
```

A high `fan_in` on the hotspot module means changes ripple. A wide `context-span` `files` count means the module is also expensive to reason about end-to-end. Stage the refactor: extract first, then change the implementation.

### 5. Map blast radius at the function level

Module-level coupling tells you which modules depend on the hotspot. To answer "which functions specifically call the function I'm about to change?" use `function-graph`:

```bash
agent-lens analyze function-graph crates/<name>/src --format md   # sanity counts
agent-lens analyze function-graph crates/<name>/src \
  | jq --arg fn "Coupling::collect" '
      .edges[] | select(.callee_name == ($fn | split("::") | last))
                 | {from, callee_name, call_lines}'
```

Useful patterns:

- **Callers**: filter edges by `callee_name` (or `to == "<file>:<name>:<line>"` for resolved hits) to enumerate call sites before signature changes.
- **Callees / blast radius**: filter edges by `from == "<node id>"` to see what the function depends on. A high `outgoing_call_count` warns that extraction will fan out into many helpers.
- **Apparently-dead code**: nodes with `incoming_call_count == 0` outside tests / public API / hooks are candidates to delete after the refactor lands.

The graph is heuristic — `unresolved` and `ambiguous` edges are normal (trait dispatch, dynamic calls, external imports). Treat `function-graph` as a "where might this break?" prompt, not a verifier.

## Reading the metrics

| Signal                | Threshold | What it means                                             |
| --------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hotspot rank          | top 5     | Where to spend refactor budget first                      |
| Cognitive             | ≥ 25      | Hard to hold in your head; bug magnet                     |
| Cognitive             | 15–24     | Yellow flag; consider splitting                           |
| Maintainability Index | < 65      | Hard to maintain regardless of cyclomatic                 |
| LCOM4                 | ≥ 2       | `impl` has disjoint responsibilities                      |
| Cyclomatic alone      | —         | Don't anchor on this; cognitive is the more useful number |

## Output format for the user

When summarising back to the user, lead with the action, not the number:

> `crates/lens-rust/src/coupling.rs` — touched 47× in 6 months, `cognitive_max = 38` in `Coupling::collect`. Splitting out edge collection from the report builder would cap the per-function cognitive at ~15 each.

Don't dump the raw JSON. The skill is for the user; the analyzer's `--format md` already trims to the essentials.

## Don't reach for it when

- The repo isn't a git working tree — `hotspot` errors out. Use `complexity` directly on a path instead.
- The user already knows which file to refactor — skip hotspot, go straight to `complexity` + `cohesion` on that file.
- There are < 50 commits of history — hotspot ranking is unstable on small repos. Eyeball complexity directly.
